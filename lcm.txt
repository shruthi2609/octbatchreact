Problem 1:

Declare two variables: admin and name.
Assign the value "John" to name.
Copy the value from name to admin.
Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).


Problem 2:

What is the output of the script?

let name = "Ilya";

alert( `hello ${1}` ); // ?

alert( `hello ${"name"}` ); // ?

alert( `hello ${name}` ); // ?


Problem 3:

What are the final values of all variables a, b, c and d after the code below?

let a = 1, b = 1;

let c = ++a; // ?
let d = b++; // ?

Problem 4:

What are the values of a and x after the code below?

let a = 2;

let x = 1 + (a *= 2);


Problem 5:

Here’s a code that asks the user for two numbers and shows their sum.

It works incorrectly. The output in the example below is 12 (for default prompt values).

Why? Fix it. The result should be 3.

let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);

alert(a + b); // 12
